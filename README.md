A basic Javascript/browser implementation of the classic Snake game - as played by everyone on their phones c. 2000, with countless other implementations since.

I made this mainly as an exercise, thinking I should be able to do it on my own in a few days. As it was, I had a basically working game in less than 2 hours - although I have fixed a few minor bugs, and tweaked various things (mainly the snake's speed progression) since then.

I know there are plenty of existing JS Snake implementations out there - I have not looked at the code for any of them. I'm sure there must be many similarities, but they are due to coding the same basic game mechanics - as well as possibly coincidence :)

Although the JS code for the game is my own, most of the user interface - including all of the user authentication - is due to the awesome [Eventyret](https://github.com/Eventyret) :)
